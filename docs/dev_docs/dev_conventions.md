# Branch && Commit Syntax
For branches we use semantic prefixes (See below)  
[Link to semantic discussion](https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716)
```
Branches:
    feat_<name_of_feature>
    test_<name_of_test>
    docs_<name_of_docs>
    fix_<name_of_fix>
    style_<name_of_style>
    refactor_<name_of_refactor>
    chore_<name_of_chore>
```
This is the semantic syntax for commits
```
